# Phase-Retrieval
This Python code implements an iterative phase retrieval algorithm to reconstruct the pupil function and model astigmatic point spread functions (PSFs) from 3D microscopy data. It uses Zernike polynomials for aberration correction, Gaussian filtering for noise reduction, and parallel processing for efficiency
